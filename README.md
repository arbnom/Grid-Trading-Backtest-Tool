# Grid-Trading-Backtest-Tool
This tool is designed to calculate the results of a grid trading strategy given specific parameters. It uses raw ETH/USDC data, which includes time, open, high, low, close, volume values exported from TradingView. The primary data, named average_price_data.csv, is derived from the raw data by averaging the high and low values for each minute.
